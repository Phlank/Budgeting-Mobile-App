Sixth Meeting
=============

Summary
-------

Gave report on what we accomplished in Iteration 5 and what we were going to do with the remaining days until Friday. Also went over once again our plans for documentation for the project. We did the meeting over Microsoft Teams, and that gave us opportunities to demo our full project to Bryan.

Reactions
---------

-	Both Bryan and Dan said that they were impressed with all of the roles we had to play in this project, and that we should be proud of ourselves.
-	Wasn't able to demo the month transition, but we got it working before the due date and sent them an email describing roughly how it works.
