Progress Report - Budgeting Mobile App
======================================

12-03-2019

At the moment, we are focused on finishing three components of the software simultaneously. There's some input we will need from you regarding direction to take in one of the aspects here.

Conversion to Flutter
---------------------

So far we have nearly entirely moved our codebase into Flutter, which will allow us to compile the app for both iOS and Android. Only a few components remain. This process has taken longer than we had hoped simply because it's the end of the semester and we have been bogged down with some other obligations. All of us have been working on this aspect of the project.

Saving, Loading, and Basic Memory Usage
---------------------------------------

A budget needs to keep track of itself. As time moves forwards, there's also a lot of transactions that we will have logged, whether it's in an Accutech server or on the hard drive of the device running the app.
